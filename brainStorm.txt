Design Decisions (what do people want?)

- I like Michal Oslam's Design
  what I like about it:

    2) gives a sense of design style from very beginning, informing decisions
    3) Not a lot is changing at any one time

    2) Choice in design
      - Light, dark?

4) Under Editor panel, finishing buttons:
